fix bug where wrong info in myLibrary would change

Fix the bug where the readornot checkbox would change the wrong info 
in the myLibrary array. This was due to the bookRead function
comparing the title being pressed to what book was just added.
making it so that if the checkbox being pressed would change the book
the user just added, instead of the one being pressed

Make title and author a prerequisite for the info to change in the
myLibrary array to avoid two authors with the same title getting
mixed up.
